 # The uniq command is used to remove duplicate lines from a text file in Linux.

 # To display only duplicate lines, use the -d option.
 # To display the number of times each line occured along with the duplicate lines. 

 By default, uniq prints its input lines, except that it discards !all but the first of adjacent repeated 
 lines!, so that no output lines are repeated. Optionally, it can instead discard lines that are not 
 repeated, or all repeated lines.
