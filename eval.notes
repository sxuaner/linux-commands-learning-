# Name
eval â€” construct command by concatenating arguments

# Description
The eval utility shall construct a command by concatenating arguments!(of string type)! together, separating each with a 
<space> character. The constructed command shall be read and executed by the shell.
It does not read from stdin nor stdout.  The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages


# APPLICATION USAGE         
       Since eval is not required to recognize the "--" end of options
       delimiter, in cases where the argument(s) to eval might begin
       with '-' it is recommended that the first argument is prefixed by
       a string that will not alter the commands to be executed, such as
       a <space> character:
           eval " $commands"
       or:
           eval " $(some_command)"

eval " $(cat some-file)"
