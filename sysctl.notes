# difference between sysctl and systemctl
sysctl and systemctl are two completely different things, and none replaced the other. sysctl sets or queries 
certain kernel parameters (see "man sysctl"), while systemctl allows to communicate with systemd.
# get or set kernel state 

# To get machine memeory size 
sysctl -a | grep hw.*mem

# To get info about cpu
sysctl -a | grep cpu
