sort -- sort or merge records (lines) of text and binary files

The sort utility sorts text and binary files by lines.  A line is a record separated from the subsequent record by a newline (default) or NUL '\0' character (-z option).  A
record can contain any printable or unprintable characters.  Comparisons are based on one or more sort keys extracted from each line of input, and are performed lexicographi-
cally, according to the current locale's collating rules and the specified command-line options that can tune the actual sorting behavior.  By default, if keys are not given,
sort uses entire lines for comparison.
